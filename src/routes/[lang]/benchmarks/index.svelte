        <h1>Benchmarks for Kryptokrona</h1>
        <p>Here are all of the hardware that have been mining Kryptokrona on XMrig.</p>
        <p>Compare your own hashrates to other people. Some hashrates will vary so you need to take it with a grain of salt. Note that everyone is not lucky in the silicon lottery and your hashrates will vary from other ones in this list.</p>
        <p>Remember you can contribute to this list! We need people like you to fill in your own hashrates to make the list more accurate.</p>

        <p>You can contribute by joining the Discord server and post your hashrates either in #mining-benchmarks or dm #Hoover2245. Your pictures should show your xmrig running and system info. If you got some overclocks to it, show it too. After some time your own hashrates will be up and running for everyone to see!</p>
