# How to buy XKR

In this guide I will show you how to buy XKR on the exchange [Exbitron](exbitron.com).

## 1. Make an account

First we are going registrer an account on Exbitron, so we can send, trade and recive crypto. 

Open up the webpage and click the red "Register" button at the top right. You could also paste in https://www.exbitron.com/signup in your browser.
Fill in your email and choose a password. Confirm this password and check off the Terms Of Service box. Then do the chapta and click the yellow "Register Button".

You will then get a verification email, so move over to your inbox. Double check that the email comes from info@exbitron.com, and click the blue "Confirm" button.
Log so in with your email and password. 

You will now see your wallet.

For this guide I will show you how to buy XKR with DOGE. To do that we need to generate a DOGE wallet. 

Click the "Search" box and type in DOGE. Click on the DOGE box. On the right you will see a yellow "Generate DOGE address". Click that button to generate your DOGE address for the exchange.

When done, you should see something like this.

Do the same to XKR

_WARNINIG : MINING DIRECTLY TO THIS DEPOSIT ADDRESS IS PROHIBITED. WE PROVIDE NO SUPPORT FOR COINS SENT FROM POOL._

## Send funds to your wallet

You will now see your deposit address. I will swap some BTC for DOGE on THORSwap, and send the DOGE to my deposit address. I do this with copying the address and send the funds to it.

When you have sent your funds, it needs to be confirmed six times before it showes up in your wallet

To see how many confirmaitons you have left, scroll down to the bottom of the webpage. Here you can see your deposit history. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166160877-473a2956-aba7-4e45-9a4b-78cb149d00ee.png)

The status will show up as 1/6 if it has only been confirmed once. In my example, it got confirmed six times and the status says it's checked. 

Now you got your DOGE, but we want XKR, right?

## How to buy XKR for DOGE

Click on the Exbitron logo at the top left to get in the homepage. 

The quickest way to find the trading pair, is to just search for XKR in the search bar over all of the pairs listed on the front page. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166161025-544d4200-a94d-4003-b190-d9e56920e5b2.png)

Here you get an overview over all of the trading pairs that you can buy/sell XKR with. As said, we will use DOGE for this tutorial, but it's the same process on the others, just not the same trading pair. 

Click on the XKR/DOGE pair

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166161110-33bc236d-2d0c-4d41-886d-96b28b190ba6.png)

We want to check out the order book for XKR/DOGE. In my example only one person wants to sell us XKR for DOGE. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166161187-ef474f24-1779-4b8e-8c0c-b1d1dcf70fb6.png)

To get XKR straight away, click on the order to get the price of what the seller is asking for. This will fill in the price for XKR per DOGE. 

Your buy order should look something like this 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166161226-544977c5-ce79-4049-a66a-6481d7b7cfa1.png)

In my example I want to use all my 169 DOGE (nice) to buy XKR with. We do this with clicking the "100%" button to say we want to use all of our DOGE in this buy order.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166161348-4076d0af-690b-4b23-a753-a4d82bc892de.png)

This means all of your DOGE will not get spent/added in the order. 

Press so the green "Buy" button to place your buy order. 

You will then get a message if you really want to place this buy order.

We press the yellow "confirm" button, to say yes.

And as that, it is confirmed!

## Check you balance and send XKR to your own wallet 

Click on the menu at the top right, and so on balance.

Search for XKR. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166161627-c9f93a60-cbc9-4624-957c-1b9f0526f699.png)

Here I've got my XKR into my wallet. But we want to keep them somewhere safe. 

_Remember, not your keys, not your crypto!_

_As Swepool says it_

In my example I will use the [desktop wallet](https://github.com/kryptokrona/kryptokrona-desktop-wallet/releases). I am taking for granted that you have set up your wallet, and stored your seedphrase somewhere safe.

Click on the "recive" button on your wallet to get your wallet address and copy it.

Move back to your overview to your XKR on Exbitron, and click the "Withdaw" button. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166161997-8ab74225-1ff0-4b2e-b21c-5ac97a8a6b5d.png)

Click the "Add Address" button and paste in your address. I would also advice to fill in a name and description to the wallet, so in future trades you don't need to fill in the address each time.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166162092-5e8d0f04-2dc3-4c98-9058-b497f4b4566e.png)

Click the yellow "Submit for confirmation" button, and your withdraw wallet is added.

Press the "All" button to send all of your XKR to the wallet, and fill in the 2FA code. I got mine on the Authenticator app because I used my @gmail. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166162285-540d93a7-dcf7-4a55-b7a4-2a7aace6237d.png)

_For Withdrawal, please check the [fees list](https://www.exbitron.com/kb/fees.html)._

Click so on the yellow "WITHDRAW" button, and press confirm.

You will then get a confirmation that the money is on the way!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83395536/166162378-75619ac3-0b08-4d26-ab24-60c371f99653.png)

The transaction could take some seconds to show up in your wallet. In my case it showed up under 30 seconds.

And as that, you bought your first XKR with DOGE.
